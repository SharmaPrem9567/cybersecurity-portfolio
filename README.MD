# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository contains my hands-on practice in offensive web security, based on real labs, CTF machines, and intentionally vulnerable applications.

The focus is on understanding vulnerabilities through manual testing, exploiting them in a controlled environment, and documenting findings clearly and honestly.

## Current Scope

- SQL Injection (manual exploitation and basic automation)
- Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected, Stored, DOM-based)
- One CTF machine with a complete attack chain writeup

The goal at this stage is solid fundamentals and clean technical reporting, not tool quantity.

## Repository Structure

### writeups/

Detailed walkthroughs documenting:

- Vulnerability identification
- Exploitation steps
- Impact analysis
- Basic mitigation guidance

This is the primary section of the repository.

### screenshots/

Supporting evidence referenced in writeups, including:

- Enumeration output
- Exploitation success
- CTF flags

Screenshots are included only where they add technical clarity.

### tools/

This directory is reserved for custom scripts and small automation tools.
No tools have been added yet.

### notes/

Personal reference notes created during learning.
These are not intended as polished guides.
