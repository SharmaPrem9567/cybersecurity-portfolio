# Custom Security Tools (Work in Progress)

This directory will contain custom tools and scripts developed during my offensive security learning journey.

## Planned Tools

The focus will be on small, practical tools that solve real problems encountered during labs and CTFs, such as:

- SQL injection helper scripts (payload automation, response analysis)
- XSS testing helpers (parameter reflection checks, sink detection)
- Directory and subdomain enumeration helpers
- Simple Python scripts for recon and automation
- Lab-specific exploit scripts where manual exploitation was required

## Current Status

No custom tools have been added yet.

Week 1 was focused on:

- Web vulnerability fundamentals (SQLi, XSS)
- Manual exploitation
- Proper documentation and writeups

Tool development will begin from Week 2 onwards as part of automation and efficiency improvement.

## Language & Stack

- Python
- Bash
- Linux utilities

Each tool added here will include:

- Clear purpose
- Usage instructions
- Example output
