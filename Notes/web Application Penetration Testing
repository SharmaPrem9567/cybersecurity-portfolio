# Web Application Penetration Testing

These notes summarise core web application penetration testing concepts
and methodology applied during hands-on labs and CTF exercises.
The concepts below were reinforced through practical exploitation
of the VulnNet: dotpy CTF machine.

## Web Application Pentesting Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance & Enumeration

- Identify exposed services, frameworks, and technologies
- Locate user-controlled input points (parameters, forms, headers)
- Observe application behavior when inputs are modified

In VulnNet: dotpy, service enumeration identified a Flask-based web
application, which guided further testing toward Python-specific issues.

---

### 2. Vulnerability Identification

- Analyze how user input is processed server-side
- Differentiate between static reflection and dynamic execution
- Look for inconsistent or unexpected application responses

In VulnNet: dotpy, modifying user input resulted in dynamic server
responses, indicating server-side processing rather than static rendering.

---

### 3. Exploitation Principles

- Start with low-impact tests to confirm vulnerability class
- Escalate exploitation only after confirmation
- Avoid blind payload dumping; focus on understanding execution flow

The VulnNet: dotpy exploitation demonstrated how confirming server-side
template evaluation is critical before attempting full command execution.

---

### 4. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

- Occurs when user input is rendered directly within a server-side template
- Common in template engines such as Jinja2 (Flask), Twig, or Velocity
- Can lead to remote code execution if template context is unrestricted

Key indicators observed in VulnNet: dotpy:

- User input evaluated dynamically
- Template expressions executed server-side
- Access to underlying language objects was possible

---

### 5. Impact Assessment

- Remote code execution
- Data exposure
- Privilege escalation due to weak system hardening

VulnNet: dotpy highlighted how a single web vulnerability can result in
full system compromise when combined with misconfigured privileges.

---

### 6. Mitigation & Defensive Considerations

- Never render unsanitized user input in templates
- Apply strict input validation and context-aware escaping
- Restrict template engine capabilities
- Enforce least privilege for application users and system permissions

---

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding application behavior is more important than payload memorization
- Web vulnerabilities often chain into system-level compromise
- Secure coding and proper privilege separation are equally important
