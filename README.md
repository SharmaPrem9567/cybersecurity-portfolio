# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository contains my hands-on cybersecurity practice, focused on
web application security, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation.

The work here reflects practical learning through CTFs, labs, and
intentionally vulnerable applications, with an emphasis on
real-world attack methodology and clear security reporting.

## Repository Structure

- writeups/  
  Professional CTF walkthroughs documenting end-to-end attack chains,
  including enumeration, exploitation, impact, and mitigation.

- tools/  
  Custom scripts and security automation tools developed during practice
  (Python / Bash).

- notes/  
  Condensed technical notes covering core web application security concepts
  and methodologies.

- screenshots/  
  Evidence and supporting screenshots referenced in writeups.

## Recommended Starting Point

- Start with the writeups/ directory to review end-to-end CTF walkthroughs.
- VulnNet: dotpy demonstrates server-side template injection leading to
  remote code execution in a Python web application.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Web Application Penetration Testing
- SQL Injection (In-band, Blind, Auth Bypass)
- Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected, Stored, DOM-based)
- Directory Enumeration
- Vulnerability Analysis & Reporting
